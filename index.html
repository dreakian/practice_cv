        <em>I am an English Teacher who is learning <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>!</em>
      </p>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of the <strong><a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a></strong>. I've been working for a few months as an English teacher for a Brazilian company.
        <br>
        I am learning Python and Web Development so that I can work with companies to develop interactive educational experiences for a wider audience.
        <br>
        Other than that, I am interested in also working in the Data Science industry! For this, I want to be able to help companies generate insights
        about their data so that they can solve their unique challenges!
        <br>
        In particular, I would love to support companies that are centered around social change and social services.
